The SELECT DISTINCT statement is used to return only distinct (different) values.

Example :- Select all the different countries from the "Customers" table:
SELECT DISTINCT Country FROM Customers;

Syntax
SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name;

Count Distinct
By using the DISTINCT keyword in a function called COUNT, we can return the number of different countries.
