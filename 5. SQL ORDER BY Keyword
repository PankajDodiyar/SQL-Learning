The ORDER BY keyword is used to sort the result-set in ascending or descending order.

Example :- Sort the products by price:
SELECT * FROM Products ORDER BY Price;

Syntax
SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name ORDER BY column1, column2, ... ASC|DESC;

The ORDER BY keyword sorts the records in ascending order by default. To sort the records in descending order, use the DESC keyword.

Example :- Sort the products from highest to lowest price:
SELECT * FROM Products ORDER BY Price DESC;
